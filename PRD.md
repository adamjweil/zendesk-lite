**Project Overview**

- **Project Name:** "Zendesk-Lite"
- **Product Goal:** To create a lightweight, user-friendly helpdesk system for small to medium-sized businesses, replicating key features and aesthetics of Zendesk.

**Target Users**

- **Primary:** Customer support teams, especially in small to medium businesses.
- **Secondary:** Business owners or managers overseeing customer support operations.

**Key Features**

**1. Ticket Management**

- **Creation:** Users can create tickets via email, web forms, or directly through the application. Include fields for subject, description, priority, and category.
- **Assignment:** Tickets can be assigned to specific agents or left unassigned for distribution based on workload or expertise.
- **Statuses:** Tickets should have statuses like "New", "Open", "Pending", "Resolved", "Closed".
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Allow sorting by date, priority, status, and agent. Implement search functionality for quick ticket retrieval.

**2. User Interface**

- **Design Aesthetic:** Adopt a clean, minimalistic design similar to Zendesk, using a color scheme that emphasizes usability (e.g., blues, whites, and grays).
- **Layout:** Dashboard with sidebar for navigation (Tickets, Users, Knowledge Base, etc.), main content area for ticket details, and top navigation for settings and notifications.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

**3. Knowledge Base**

- **Article Creation:** Allow content managers to create, edit, and categorize articles.
- **Search:** Implement a powerful search feature for users to find help articles easily.
- **Public Access:** Option to make the knowledge base accessible to customers or keep it internal.

**4. User Management**

- **Roles & Permissions:** Define roles such as Admin, Agent, and Customer. Admins can manage users, agents can handle tickets, and customers can view their tickets.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profiles, change passwords, etc.

**5. Notifications**

- **Email Notifications:** Alerts for new tickets, ticket updates, or when a ticket is assigned or resolved.
- **In-app Notifications:** Real-time updates within the application for agents.

**6. Reporting**

- **Basic Metrics:** Track metrics like ticket volume, first response time, resolution time, and customer satisfaction.
- **Visual Reports:** Simple charts or graphs for overview.

**7. Integration**

- **Email:** Seamless integration with email services for ticket creation and updates.
- **API:** A basic API for extending the functionality or integrating with other tools.

**Technical Specifications**

- **Frontend:**
    - **Framework:** React for a dynamic and component-based UI.
    - **Styling:** Use DaisyUI with modern styling
- **Backend:**
    - **Database & BaaS:** Use Supabase for backend services including real-time database, authentication, and API development.
    - **Authentication:** Implement Supabase Authentication for user registration, login, and session management.
- **Hosting:**
    - **Service:** AWS Amplify for hosting both the frontend and backend, providing CI/CD, authentication integration, and easy deployment from Git repositories.
- **Security:**
    - Leverage Supabase's built-in security rules for row-level security.
    - Use HTTPS for all communications.
    - Implement proper error handling and logging to avoid information leakage.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance:** The application should handle concurrent users smoothly with Supabase's managed scaling solutions.
- **Scalability:** Designed to scale with Supabase's infrastructure for handling larger data sets and user bases.
- **Usability:** Intuitive interface with help documentation or tooltips for key functionalities.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure compliance with WCAG for accessibility.

**Development Timeline**

- **Phase 1:** Design and setup of React frontend with Supabase integration (1 month)
- **Phase 2:** Core functionality (Ticketing, User Management) using Supabase features (2 months)
- **Phase 3:** Knowledge Base and Reporting (1.5 months)
- **Phase 4:** Integration with AWS Amplify for deployment and final testing (1 month)
- **Total:** Approximately 5.5 months

**Risks and Assumptions**

- **Risks:**
    - Dependency on third-party services like Supabase for backend functionality, which might introduce points of failure.
    - Migration of data or logic from Supabase to another system if needed could be complex.
- **Assumptions:**
    - Developers have experience with React and can quickly adapt to Supabase's services.
    - AWS Amplify will provide seamless hosting and deployment experiences.

**Success Metrics**

- **User Engagement:** Number of tickets created, average resolution time.
- **User Satisfaction:** Feedback scores, repeat customer rate.
- **System Uptime:** Measure system reliability and performance.
